# Computer Graphics Basics Class Project

Small project for a university class made in March 2022. Initially a monkey was supposed to raise a banana, but I modified the idea to make it more interesting and it is Rafiki from The Lion King raising Simba. 

# Features
- Putting Simba in Rafiki's hand (a smile appears on his face)
- Raising or lowering the holding hand with a slider (it makes the progress bar change)
- Choosing between a star, a sun or a moon
- Choosing the color of the star
- Writing a text that appears next to Rafiki
- Saving the image to JPG/PNG/BMP file

# Technologies
- C++
- wxWidgets library
- Visual Studio
